            <h3>Engineering Design and Innovation (EDI):</h3>
            <p>This course focuses on developing innovative solutions through engineering design principles. It covers various aspects of engineering design, including problem identification, ideation, prototyping, and testing.</p>
            <p class="course-relevance">Course Relevance:</p>
            <p>Project Centric Learning (PCL) is a powerful tool for students to work in areas
                of their choice and strengths. Along with course based projects, curriculum can be enriched with
                semester long Engineering Design and Development courses, in which students can solve socially
                relevant problems using various technologies from relevant disciplines. The various socially relevant
                domains can be like Health care, Agriculture, Defense, Education, Smart City, Smart Energy and
                Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan. To gain the necessary skills to tackle such projects, students can select
                relevant online courses and acquire skills from numerous sources under guidance of faculty and
                enrich their knowledge in the project domain, thereby achieving project centric learning. Modern
                world sustained and advanced through the successful completion of projects. In short, if students are
                prepared for success in life, we need to prepare them for a project-based world. It is a style of active
                learning and inquiry-based learning. Project centric learning will also redefine the role of teacher as
                mentor in the learning process. The PCL model focuses the student on a big open-ended question,
                challenge, or problem to research and respond to and/or solve. It brings students not only to know,
                understand and remember rather it takes them to analyze, design and apply categories of Bloomâ€™s
                Taxonomy</p>

            <h3>Software Design and Modelling (SDAM):</h3>
            <p>This course covers the principles of software design and modeling. It includes topics such as software architecture, design patterns, and modeling techniques.</p>
            <p class="course-relevance">Course Relevance:</p>
            <p>Given that Software Engineering is built upon the foundations of Computer Science as well as
                Computer Engineering, a Software Engineering curriculum can be focused on two perspectives - a
                Computer Science-first or Software Engineering-first perspective. Software engineering spans the
                entire software lifecycle. It involves creating high-quality and reliable programs in a systematic,
                controlled, and efficient manner using formal methods for specification, analysis, design and
                evaluation of proposed systems. It requires suitable software development techniques and processes
                that successfully scale to large applications, which should satisfy timing, size, and security
                requirements all within acceptable application/project budgets and deadlines. For these reasons,
                Software Engineering requires both the analytical and descriptive tools and techniques developed in
                Computer Science and the rigor that the Computer Engineering discipline brings to the reliability and
                trustworthiness of the systems that software developers design and implement, while working as a
                cohesive team.</p>

            <h3>Web Technology (WT):</h3>
            <p>The key technology of the information age is global communication. Web technology enables global communication through web sites and applications. This course covers essential web technologies, including descriptive languages, server-side and client-side programming, and information security principles.</p>
            <p class="course-relevance">Course Relevance:</p>
            <p>The key technology of the information age is global communication. Web technology is a truly
                global area of study as it enables global communication with the help of web sites. Web technologies
                are the backbone of all IT infrastructures and their applications in the world. These technologies and
                applications often emerge in communication within countries of countries and spread rapidly around
                the world. The main objective of the course is present the basic web technology concepts that are
                required for developing web applications. The key technology components are descriptive languages,
                server-side program elements and client-side program elements. In addition, the course gives specific
                contents that are beneficial for developing web-based solutions, like relational data-base
                communication basics and information security principles and approaches. Most of the jobs available
                in the IT industries are web technology related.</p>
